# e-Money Ecosystem Fund
Grants are offered from the Ecosystem Fund to qualified partners, subject to vesting periods. Applications are considered on an ongoing basis.

Examples of applicants that are eligible to receive grants are:
* Validators for the e-Money zone.
* Wallet providers that commit to integrating current and future currency-backed tokens and/or the zone's exchange-functionality.
* Exchanges that commit to listing current and future currency-backed tokens.
* Applications using our currency-backed tokens, e.g. as a means of payment.

Get in touch on partners@e-money.com to initiate the dialogue.

## Validators for the e-Money Zone
Grants will be offered for the first two years after mainnet launch.

A fixed amount of NGM 2000 is paid out (at least) monthly to the self-delegation address of each validator in the **active set**.

The grant is paid out automatically, so there is no need to apply for it.
